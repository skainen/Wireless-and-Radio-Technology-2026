Design appropriate filters to isolate specific frequency components from a composite input signal.

Input Signal: The input signal is a sum of sine waves with the following frequencies:

Task:  Suggest appropriate filters to isolate the following frequency components from the input signal. You will need to decide on the filter type (Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, or Band Stop) and specify the cutoff frequency or frequencies.

Instructions:

For each of the frequency components listed below, fill in the table with the corresponding filter type and cutoff frequency/frequencies
